# Customer Churn Prediction for Telecommunications

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using a machine learning algorithms. The analysis focuses on identifying key factors that contribute to customer retention and offers actionable insights to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce churn rates.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various customer attributes, including demographic information, service usage, and contract details. Key columns include:

- **customerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **gender**: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- **SeniorCitizen**: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **Partner**: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes/No).
- **Dependents**: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes/No).
- **tenure**: Number of months the customer has been with the service.
- **PhoneService**: Whether the customer has a phone service (Yes/No).
- **MultipleLines**: Whether the customer has multiple lines (Yes/No).
- **InternetService**: Type of internet service (DSL/Fiber optic/No internet service).
- **OnlineSecurity**: Whether the customer has online security (Yes/No).
- **OnlineBackup**: Whether the customer has online backup (Yes/No).
- **DeviceProtection**: Whether the customer has device protection (Yes/No).
- **TechSupport**: Whether the customer has tech support (Yes/No).
- **StreamingTV**: Whether the customer has streaming TV service (Yes/No).
- **StreamingMovies**: Whether the customer has streaming movies service (Yes/No).
- **Contract**: Type of contract (Month-to-month/One year/Two year).
- **PaperlessBilling**: Whether the customer has paperless billing (Yes/No).
- **PaymentMethod**: Method of payment (Electronic check/Mailed check/Bank transfer/Credit card).
- **MonthlyCharges**: Monthly charge for the customer.
- **TotalCharges**: Total charge for the customer.
- **Churn**: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).

## Model
The logistic regression model was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The model achieved an accuracy of 80%, providing a strong foundation for identifying at-risk customers.

## Key Insights
- Customers on month-to-month contracts and those using electronic checks are at a higher risk of churning.
- Feature analysis reveals several predictors that significantly influence churn rates.

## Business Implications
This analysis enables telecommunications companies to:
- Implement targeted retention strategies for high-risk customers.
- Optimize service offerings based on churn predictors.
- Enhance customer support initiatives to address potential issues proactively.

## Next Steps
Future work can involve:
- Testing additional algorithms for improved predictions.
- Regularly updating the model with new data to maintain accuracy.
- Implementing A/B testing for retention strategies based on model predictions.
